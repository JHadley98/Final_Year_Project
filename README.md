# Final_Year_Project
For this project, I will be creating a third person survival game, in which the game will load with a different map each time a new game is loaded, with the use of procedural generation. The project will also consist of implementing other generic game features such as; AI, item pickups and a health system. 
All assets used in this project are free to use and available on the asset store.
All code is created and copyrighted by myself.
